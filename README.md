-> Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

In an effort to reach more customers, social media company Chat Away wants to develop a mobile platform version of their website. This app needs to be distributable in both Android and iPhone app stores. Budget and timeline remain a high priority within the project.

-> What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I was able to bring atention to the realtive strenghts and weaknesses of solutions we provided.

-> What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Some amount of discovery about a project is always helpful. That is, lay out the potential directions and then try to describe what each adds or subtracts from the project. The most difficult part was finding out where to begin and where to end as there was little input on how much was enough.

-> If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I could have put more details about security. The details I laid out in general were very bare bones.

-> How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

If you are not addressing your user's needs they will abandon your application as soon as there is a better option. Updates are always required because eventually people will get bored of what you have if it stays stagnant.
